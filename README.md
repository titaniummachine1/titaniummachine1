### 🧠 Cool Stuff I've Built
- 🚀 **Navmesh Stitcher** — directional edge-based area stitching using 1D traversal; avoids 2D grid overhead while ensuring clean area pairing.
- 📊 **Profiler Library** — real-time memory & time profiling for Lua-based tools, especially useful under heavy simulation loads.
- 🎯 **Cheat Detection Engine(wip)** — confidence-weighted system with evidence decay, SteamID64 indexing, and automatic local database syncing.
- 💥 **Projectile Aimbot (WIP)** — early-stage predictive targeting system for TF2 projectiles using physics-based arc compensation and velocity tracking.
- 🥊 **Swing Prediction (Advanced Melee Aimbot)** — near-perfect real-time melee prediction with swing arcs, desync handling, and adaptive target offsetting (instant swing in progress).

> 🧪 Most of my work focuses on real-time performance in constrained environments (like TF2 Lua scripting). I prioritize deterministic logic, clean architecture, and measurable gains — even in weird engines.
